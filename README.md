<h2>Swim and Survive Game</h2>

This project was based on fixing a broken game and making it my own. I did so by changing all the styles, images, and adding new features to the JavaScript files to improve the gaming experience.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding the sharks that are raining from above. The longer you stay alive, the higher your score!
